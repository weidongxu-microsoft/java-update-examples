<!--
  This is the upgrade progress tracker generated during plan execution.
  Each step from plan.md should be tracked here with status, changes, verification results, and TODOs.

  ## EXECUTION RULES

  !!! DON'T REMOVE THIS COMMENT BLOCK BEFORE UPGRADE IS COMPLETE AS IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS.

  ### Success Criteria
  - **Goal**: All user-specified target versions met
  - **Compilation**: Both main source code AND test code compile = `mvn clean test-compile` succeeds
  - **Test**: 100% test pass rate = `mvn clean test` succeeds (or ≥ baseline with documented pre-existing flaky tests), but ONLY in Final Validation step. **Skip if user set "Run tests before and after the upgrade: false" in plan.md Options.**

  ### Strategy
  - **Uninterrupted run**: Complete execution without pausing for user input
  - **NO premature termination**: Token limits, time constraints, or complexity are NEVER valid reasons to skip fixing.
  - **Automation tools**: Use OpenRewrite etc. for efficiency; always verify output

  ### Verification Expectations
  - **Steps 1-N (Setup/Upgrade)**: Focus on COMPILATION SUCCESS (both main and test code).
    - On compilation success: Commit and proceed (even if tests fail - document count)
    - On compilation error: Fix IMMEDIATELY and re-verify until both main and test code compile
    - **NO deferred fixes** (for compilation): "Fix post-merge", "TODO later", "can be addressed separately" are NOT acceptable. Fix NOW or document as genuine unfixable limitation.
  - **Final Validation Step**: Achieve COMPILATION SUCCESS + 100% TEST PASS (if tests enabled in plan.md Options).
    - On test failure: Enter iterative test & fix loop until 100% pass or rollback to last-good-commit after exhaustive fix attempts
    - **NO deferring test fixes** - this is the final gate
    - **NO categorical dismissals**: "Test-specific issues", "doesn't affect production", "sample/demo code" are NOT valid reasons to skip. ALL tests must pass.
    - **NO "close enough" acceptance**: 95% is NOT 100%. Every failing test requires a fix attempt with documented root cause.
    - **NO blame-shifting**: "Known framework issue", "migration behavior change" require YOU to implement the fix or workaround.

  ### Review Code Changes (MANDATORY for each step)
  After completing changes in each step, review code changes BEFORE verification to ensure:

  1. **Sufficiency**: All changes required for the upgrade goal are present — no missing modifications that would leave the upgrade incomplete.
     - All dependencies/plugins listed in the plan for this step are updated
     - All required code changes (API migrations, import updates, config changes) are made
     - All compilation and compatibility issues introduced by the upgrade are addressed
  2. **Necessity**: All changes are strictly necessary for the upgrade — no unnecessary modifications, refactoring, or "improvements" beyond what's required. This includes:
     - **Functional Behavior Consistency**: Original code behavior and functionality are maintained:
       - Business logic unchanged
       - API contracts preserved (inputs, outputs, error handling)
       - Expected outputs and side effects maintained
     - **Security Controls Preservation** (critical subset of behavior):
       - **Authentication**: Login mechanisms, session management, token validation, MFA configurations
       - **Authorization**: Role-based access control, permission checks, access policies, security annotations (@PreAuthorize, @Secured, etc.)
       - **Password handling**: Password encoding/hashing algorithms, password policies, credential storage
       - **Security configurations**: CORS policies, CSRF protection, security headers, SSL/TLS settings, OAuth/OIDC configurations
       - **Audit logging**: Security event logging, access logging

  **Review Code Changes Actions**:
  - Review each changed file for missing upgrade changes, unintended behavior or security modifications
  - If behavior must change due to framework requirements, document the change, the reason, and confirm equivalent functionality/protection is maintained
  - Add missing changes that are required for the upgrade step to be complete
  - Revert unnecessary changes that don't affect behavior or security controls
  - Document review results in progress.md and commit message

  ### Commit Message Format
  - First line: `Step <x>: <title> - Compile: <result> | Tests: <pass>/<total> passed`
  - Body: Changes summary + concise known issues/limitations (≤5 lines)
  - **When `GIT_AVAILABLE=false`**: Skip commits entirely. Record `N/A - not version-controlled` in the **Commit** field.

  ### Efficiency (IMPORTANT)
  - **Targeted reads**: Use `grep` over full file reads; read specific sections, not entire files. Template files are large - only read the section you need.
  - **Quiet commands**: Use `-q`, `--quiet` for build/test commands when appropriate
  - **Progressive writes**: Update progress.md incrementally after each step, not at end

- **Step 3: Migrate pom.xml to Modern Azure SDK**
  - **Status**: ✅ Completed
  - **Changes Made**:

    - Added `com.azure:azure-sdk-bom:1.3.5` to dependencyManagement
    - Added `com.azure:azure-storage-blob:12.33.2`
    - Updated `com.azure:azure-identity` to `1.18.2`
  - **Review Code Changes**:
    - Sufficiency: ✅ All pom.xml changes present for Step 3
    - Necessity: ✅ All changes necessary (removed EOL dep, added modern replacement)
      - Functional Behavior: ✅ Preserved - dependency replacement only; source migration in Step 4
      - Security Controls: ✅ Preserved - replacing EOL SDK with latest secure version
  - **Verification**:
    - Command: `JAVA_HOME=... mvn clean test-compile`
    - JDK: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home
    - Build tool: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/maven/3.9.10/bin/mvn

  - **Commit**: 4bd7feb - Step 3: Migrate pom.xml to Modern Azure SDK

---

- **Step 4: Migrate BlobStorageService.java**
  - **Status**: ✅ Completed

      - Functional Behavior: ✅ Preserved - same operations (list/create/delete containers, list/upload/download/delete/getInfo blobs)
      - Security Controls: ✅ Preserved - same auth patterns (DefaultAzureCredential for Azure, connection-string for local)
  - **Verification**:
    - Command: `JAVA_HOME=... mvn clean compile`
    - JDK: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home
    - Build tool: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/maven/3.9.10/bin/mvn
    - Result: ✅ Main compilation SUCCESS; test compilation fails (legacy test types - fixed in Step 5)
  - **Deferred Work**: Test migration in Step 5
  - **Commit**: d6609a5 - Step 4: Migrate BlobStorageService.java

---

- **Step 5: Migrate BlobStorageServiceTest.java**

    - Used `doReturn(list.iterator()).when(pagedIterable).iterator()` pattern for `PagedIterable<T>` mocking
  - **Review Code Changes**:
    - Sufficiency: ✅ All test legacy types replaced; injection updated to `setBlobServiceClient()`
    - Necessity: ✅ All changes required to match migrated production service
      - Functional Behavior: ✅ Preserved - tests verify same operations as before
      - Security Controls: ✅ N/A (unit tests only)
  - **Verification**:
    - Command: `JAVA_HOME=... mvn clean test-compile`
    - JDK: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home

---

- **Step 6: Final Validation**
  - **Status**: ✅ Completed
  - **Changes Made**:

  Additional context, observations, or lessons learned during execution.
  Use this section for:
  - Unexpected challenges encountered
  - Deviation from original plan
  - Performance observations
  - Recommendations for future upgrades

  SAMPLE:
  - OpenRewrite's jakarta migration recipe saved ~4 hours of manual work
  - Hibernate 6 query syntax changes were more extensive than anticipated
  - JUnit 5 migration was straightforward thanks to Spring Boot 2.7.x compatibility layer
