- `67f9407` Step 6: Update Tests - Compile: SUCCESS

## CVEs

- Direct dependency scan result: no known CVEs requiring action
- Dependencies scanned:
  - `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:3.2.5`
  - `io.clientcore:core:1.0.0-beta.11`
  - `com.azure.v2:azure-core:2.0.0-beta.1`
  - `com.azure.v2:azure-storage-blob:13.0.0-beta.1`
  - `com.azure:azure-identity:1.14.2`

## Coverage

- Command run: `mvn clean verify -Djacoco.skip=false`
- Build result: success
- Coverage metrics: unavailable
- Reason: JaCoCo reporting is not configured in this project, so no `target/site/jacoco` report was generated

## Challenges

- The target v2 Azure artifacts were not available from Maven Central and had to be built from local `azure-sdk-for-java` source
- `azure-storage-blob` source referenced an unavailable `annotation-processor` version and required local alignment to `1.0.0-beta.5`
- The generated v2 client classes are final, requiring `mockito-inline` for unit-test migration
- Track 1 shared-key and token auth behavior required compatibility adapters in the migrated service

## Limitations

- The custom shared-key policy for connection-string authentication is unit-compiled but not covered by live integration tests in this project
- Coverage percentage could not be produced because the project does not configure JaCoCo reporting

## Next Steps

- Optional: add an integration test profile against Azurite to validate the shared-key policy at runtime
- Optional: add JaCoCo plugin configuration if coverage percentages are required for future upgrades<!--

  ## SUMMARY RULES

  !!! DON'T REMOVE THIS COMMENT BLOCK BEFORE UPGRADE IS COMPLETE AS IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS.

  ### Prerequisites (must be met before generating summary)
  - All steps in plan.md have ✅ in progress.md
  - Final Validation step completed successfully

  ### Success Criteria Verification
  - **Goal**: All user-specified target versions met
  - **Compilation**: Both main AND test code compile = `mvn clean test-compile` succeeds
  - **Test**: 100% pass rate = `mvn clean test` succeeds (or ≥ baseline with documented pre-existing flaky tests)

  ### Content Guidelines
  - **Upgrade Result**: MUST show 100% pass rate or justify EACH failure with exhaustive documentation
  - **Tech Stack Changes**: Table with Dependency | Before | After | Reason
  - **Commits**: List with IDs and messages from each step
  - **CVE Scan Results**: Post-upgrade CVE scan output — list any remaining vulnerabilities with severity, affected dependency, and recommended action
  - **Test Coverage**: Post-upgrade test coverage metrics (line, branch, instruction percentages) compared to baseline if available
  - **Challenges**: Key issues and resolutions encountered
  - **Limitations**: Only genuinely unfixable items where: (1) multiple fix approaches attempted, (2) root cause identified, (3) technically impossible to fix
  - **Next Steps**: Recommendations for post-upgrade actions

  ### Efficiency (IMPORTANT)
  - **Targeted reads**: Use `grep` over full file reads; read specific sections from progress.md, not entire files. Template files are large - only read the section you need.

## Challenges

<!--
  Document key challenges encountered during the upgrade and how they were resolved.

  SAMPLE:
  - **Jakarta EE Namespace Migration**
    - **Issue**: 150+ files required javax.* → jakarta.* namespace changes
    - **Resolution**: Used OpenRewrite `org.openrewrite.java.migrate.jakarta.JavaxMigrationToJakarta` recipe
    - **Time Saved**: ~4 hours of manual work

  - **Hibernate 6 Query Compatibility**
    - **Issue**: 5 repository methods used deprecated HQL syntax
    - **Resolution**: Updated to Hibernate 6 compatible query syntax
    - **Files Changed**: UserRepository.java, OrderRepository.java, ProductRepository.java

  - **JUnit 4 → JUnit 5 Migration**
    - **Issue**: 23 test classes used JUnit 4 annotations
    - **Resolution**: Used OpenRewrite JUnit 5 migration recipe + manual fixes for custom runners
    - **Files Changed**: 23 test files
-->

## Limitations

<!--
  Document any genuinely unfixable limitations that remain after the upgrade.
  This section should be empty if all issues were resolved.
  Only include items where: (1) multiple fix approaches were attempted, (2) root cause is identified,
  (3) fix is technically impossible without breaking other functionality.

  SAMPLE:
  - **Frontend Build Compatibility** (Out of Scope)
    - Node.js 4.4.3 is severely outdated but not upgraded as part of this Java upgrade
    - Frontend builds in prod profile may have issues
    - Recommended: Separate frontend modernization effort

  - **Deprecated API Usage** (Acceptable)
    - 2 deprecated Spring Security methods still in use
    - Marked with @SuppressWarnings with TODO for future cleanup
    - No breaking impact - methods still functional in Spring Security 6.x
-->

## Review Code Changes Summary

<!--
  Document review code changes results from the upgrade.
  This section ensures the upgrade is both sufficient (complete) and necessary (no extraneous changes),
  with original functionality and security controls preserved.

  VERIFICATION AREAS:
  1. Sufficiency: All required upgrade changes are present — no missing modifications
  2. Necessity: All changes are strictly necessary — no unnecessary modifications, including:
     - Functional Behavior Consistency: Business logic, API contracts, expected outputs
     - Security Controls Preservation (critical subset of behavior):
       - Authentication: Login mechanisms, session management, token validation, MFA configurations
       - Authorization: Role-based access control, permission checks, access policies, security annotations (@PreAuthorize, @Secured, etc.)
       - Password handling: Password encoding/hashing algorithms, password policies, credential storage
       - Security configurations: CORS policies, CSRF protection, security headers, SSL/TLS settings, OAuth/OIDC configurations
       - Audit logging: Security event logging, access logging

  SAMPLE (no issues):
  **Review Status**: ✅ All Passed

  **Sufficiency**: ✅ All required upgrade changes are present
  **Necessity**: ✅ All changes are strictly necessary
  - Functional Behavior: ✅ Preserved — business logic, API contracts unchanged
  - Security Controls: ✅ Preserved — authentication, authorization, password handling, security configs, audit logging unchanged

  SAMPLE (with behavior changes):
  **Review Status**: ⚠️ Changes Documented Below

  **Sufficiency**: ✅ All required upgrade changes are present

  **Necessity**: ⚠️ Behavior changes required by framework migration (documented below)

## CVE Scan Results

<!--
  Document the results of the post-upgrade CVE vulnerability scan.
  Run `#appmod-validate-cves-for-java(sessionId)` to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
  List any remaining CVEs with severity, affected dependency, and recommended action.

  SAMPLE (no CVEs):
  **Scan Status**: ✅ No known CVE vulnerabilities detected

  **Scanned**: 85 dependencies | **Vulnerabilities Found**: 0

  SAMPLE (with CVEs):
  **Scan Status**: ⚠️ Vulnerabilities detected

  **Scanned**: 85 dependencies | **Vulnerabilities Found**: 3

  | Severity | CVE ID         | Dependency                  | Version | Fixed In | Recommendation                    |
  | -------- | -------------- | --------------------------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
  | Critical | CVE-2024-1234  | org.example:vulnerable-lib  | 2.3.1   | 2.3.5    | Upgrade to 2.3.5                  |

-->

## Test Coverage

<!--
  Document post-upgrade test coverage metrics.
  Run tests with coverage enabled (e.g., `mvn clean verify -Djacoco.skip=false` or equivalent).
  Report coverage percentages and compare to baseline if available.

  SAMPLE (with baseline comparison):
  | Metric       | Baseline | Post-Upgrade | Delta  |
  | ------------ | -------- | ------------ | ------ |
  | Line         | 72.3%    | 73.1%        | +0.8%  |
  | Branch       | 58.7%    | 59.2%        | +0.5%  |
  | Instruction  | 68.4%    | 69.0%        | +0.6%  |

  SAMPLE (no baseline):
  | Metric       | Post-Upgrade |
  | ------------ | ------------ |
  | Line         | 73.1%        |
  | Branch       | 59.2%        |
  | Instruction  | 69.0%        |

  **Notes**: Coverage is measured after all upgrade steps. If JaCoCo/Cobertura is not configured,
  document that coverage collection was not available and recommend adding it as a next step.
-->

## Next Steps

<!--
  Recommendations for post-upgrade actions.
  Include CONDITIONAL items based on CVE scan and test coverage results:
  - If Critical or High severity CVEs were found: add "Fix CVE Issues" as a priority next step
  - If test coverage is low (e.g., line coverage < 70%): add "Generate Unit Test Cases" as a priority next step

  SAMPLE (with CVEs and low coverage):
  - [ ] **Fix CVE Issues** (Critical/High): 2 critical and 1 high severity CVEs detected — start another upgrade for these vul dependencies.
  - [ ] **Generate Unit Test Cases**: Line coverage is 45.2% — use the "Generate Unit Tests" tool/agent to improve coverage
  - [ ] Run full integration test suite in staging environment
  - [ ] Performance testing to validate no regression
  - [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines to use JDK 21
  - [ ] Remove deprecated API usages flagged during upgrade
  - [ ] Update documentation to reflect new Java/Spring versions
