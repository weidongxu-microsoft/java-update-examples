## Update metadata.csv file

Prerequisite: "metadata.csv" is opened in context. This file does not exist in this project.

For each "azure-legacy-sdk-update-" folder from root, check if metadata.csv contains the name in "instance_id".

If metadata.csv does not contain it, add a new rule to the file. Use the row "azure-legacy-sdk-update-compute-java-manage-vm" as example.
